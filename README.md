# GPFlags
GPFlags is a plugin to allow players to set flags for GriefPrevention claims. Either a single claim or a global flag for all claims. It's similar to WorldGuard, but it's more performant, easier to use, and includes many more useful flags than WorldGuard does. It also doesn't require WorldEdit to run (unlike WorldGuard). Admins can also empower players to self-serve by giving them access to specific flags, which they can then only use on land claims they own.

## Flags
There are over 80 flags and I frequently add more. A few of the more popular flags are NoMonsterSpawns, EnterMessage, AllowPvP, and NoEnter. If there's a flag you don't see here, contact me through the support Discord and I'll see what I can do.

      <td>AllowPvP</td>
      <td>If in the config "PvP Only In PvP-Flagged Claims" is set to true, PvP will be off in the world, and you can then add a flag to a claim to allow PvP in specific claims. There is also an optional message to be sent to players when they enter these claims (can be changed in the config).</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ChangeBiome</td>
      <td>You can now change the biome in claims. You can also give players permission to set flags, and they can change the biomes in their own claims.  When you are using the command to set a biome, it will give you a scrollable list of available biomes. Make sure to type them in exactly. I made the biomes that a player could use permission-based so you can stop players from using certain biomes. Give players the permission <code>gpflags.flag.changebiome.<biomename></code> for the biomes they are allowed to use. You need to use the BukkitAPI names for biomes, which can be found <a href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html">here</a>. When a claim is deleted or a ChangeBiome flag is unset, the biome will revert back to its previous state to make sure your world stays looking clean. This will prevent players from running around the world, claiming land, changing the biome, abandoning the claim, and making your world look patchy. Note that removing the flag converts the claim into the biome located just north of the claim which is only sometimes the original claim.</td>

      <td>Complex flag to create spleef arenas. SpleefArena - Completely automates a Spleef minigame (players compete to remove blocks out from under each other until someone falls) in the flagged area. <br>Example usage: <code>/SetFlag SpleefArena minecraft:snow_block minecraft:bricks 20</code>. <br>The above example will generate a snow block (minecraft:snow_block) 20 blocks above every bricks block (minecraft:bricks) in the flagged area every time a player dies in the flagged area. It will also allow ONLY snow blocks to be broken by any player even without build permission, and won't drop those blocks as items when they're broken. To set up a spleef arena, first flag the claim or subdivision as shown above. Then dig down underneath where the breakable arena surface (snow block in the above example) will be and use your marker blocks (bricks in the above example) to indicate the shape of your arena, which does NOT have to be flat, rectangular, or single-block thick. The y offset (the last flag parameter) dictates how far down you have to place the marker blocks from where you want the arena surface to generate. To test your settings, use the Vanilla /kill command while standing in the flagged area. Your death will trigger the arena surface to be built per your specifications.</td>
